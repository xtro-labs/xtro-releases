# Xtro

**Start coding on your Mac, continue on your iPhone — exactly where you left off.**

Xtro synchronizes your development environment across devices. Your Mac runs the IDE (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf) while your iPhone provides a full-featured mobile interface to interact with terminals, AI agents, source control, and more.

## Why Xtro?

AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cline, and Codex run long tasks—refactoring entire codebases, running test suites, deploying to production. You don't need to babysit them at your desk.

With Xtro, you can:
- Start a task on your Mac and walk away
- Get notified on your iPhone when the agent needs input or finishes
- Review diffs, approve changes, and continue the conversation—all from your phone
- Never miss an agent asking "Should I proceed?" while you're grabbing coffee

## Features

### Terminal Mirroring
Live terminal access from your Mac IDE. Execute commands, interact with AI CLI tools, and watch compilation output—all from your iPhone.

### AI-Agentic Workflows
- Voice-to-text prompting (minimize typing on mobile)
- Real-time notifications for agent completions, failures, and input requests
- Works with Claude Code, Cline, Gemini CLI, Codex, and more

### Source Control
Native Git integration:
- Stage/unstage files
- Create commits
- Manage branches
- Push/pull repositories

### Diff Viewer
Side-by-side code comparison with syntax highlighting. Review AI-generated changes before committing.

### Screenshot Uploads
Insert images directly from your photo library into AI agent conversations. Show the agent a bug screenshot, a design mockup, or an error message.

### Quick Keys
Single-tap shortcuts for common AI CLI commands. Bundled presets for:
- Claude Code
- Gemini CLI
- Cline
- Codex CLI
- Cursor Agent
- And more

## Supported IDEs

Xtro works with any IDE that has a terminal:
- VS Code
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Trae
